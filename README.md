# Footprints Extension
A Chrome extension written for Northwestern IT to extend the functionality of the Footprints IT Service Manager.

## Aesthetic Changes

### Card Layout
Creates a more modern, card based layout out of the tickets homepage. Issues should be much more readable and pleasant to look at. Each
separate ticket is now a card. The UI functions much the same as the original page, albeit only displaying critical information on first glance.
The ticket number in the bottom left is colored based on issue status, and it can be clicked to copy the ticket number.
